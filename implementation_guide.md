# Multi-Agent Construction Management System

## Project Description
A sophisticated AI-powered system that uses multiple specialized agents to manage all aspects of a construction business. The system features an orchestrator agent that delegates tasks to specialized agents (financial, project management, document processing, etc.), all sharing access to a persistent memory store. The system integrates with ClickUp for project management and uses document vectorization for intelligent data retrieval.

## Target Audience
- Construction business owners and executives
- Project managers and superintendents
- Financial controllers and accountants
- Field supervisors and crew leaders
